description: "It's been said that we'll have about five to seven careers in our lifetime, which seemed crazy to me when I first heard it. However, in my 31 years to date, I've worked a couple of retail jobs, was a barista, worked as a communications director, did a brief stint in consulting, and have spent the last few years as a freelance social media strategist working with some amazing organizations and causes."
